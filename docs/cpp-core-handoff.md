# C++ Core Migration — Implementation Handoff Prompt

> Paste-ready kickoff for the engineer/agent implementing the WhisperX C++ core.
> The design is settled; this is the build phase. Read the four linked docs, then
> start at Phase 0.

## Mission

Reimplement the WhisperX transcription pipeline as a **headless C++ engine core**
(`libwhisperx`) on **ONNX Runtime + sherpa-onnx**, replacing the Python
`whisperx/` internals **stage by stage** while the Python `app/` keeps running as
the host and parity oracle. The deliverable is a lean, fast, drop-in-compatible
engine — not a rewrite of the app.

## Read first (authoritative, in this order)

1. [`pipeline-reference.md`](./pipeline-reference.md) — what each stage does + exact code/line refs (the spec).
2. [`cpp-core-spa-architecture.md`](./cpp-core-spa-architecture.md) — the engine-core + adapters design and pipeline streamlining.
3. [`cpp-core-migration-plan.md`](./cpp-core-migration-plan.md) — strategy (strangler-fig via pybind11), the **session-DB compatibility contract** (§2), test/timing approach, build tooling, and the **roadmap (§6 = single source of truth)**.
4. [`cpp-core-migration-briefs.md`](./cpp-core-migration-briefs.md) — **per-phase execution briefs** (Context / Goals / Validation / Unknowns). Start with "How to read" (3 cross-cutting facts + tolerances), then Phase 0.

[`single-language-runtime-options.md`](./single-language-runtime-options.md) is background (why C++ + ORT).

## Already decided — do **not** re-open

- **Runtime:** ORT + sherpa-onnx for VAD/align/diarize; **ASR is a pluggable backend** (sherpa-onnx default; whisper.cpp/GGML for Apple-Silicon Metal). LiteRT dropped.
- **Migration:** strangler-fig — Python stays the host until Phase 5; each C++ stage swaps in behind the **pybind11 `whisperx_core`** module, gated by `WHISPERX_CORE_STAGES`.
- **Validation (decoupled goldens):** Whisper text isn't byte-stable across engines → test align/diarize/writers against a **fixed transcript input**; judge ASR by **WER/CER**. "Byte-identical" only ever means *given identical input*.
- **Audio:** **ffmpeg libraries linked in-process** (Option B), no subprocess, all formats.
- **DB:** **replace** `app/store.py` with a C++ `SessionStore` (SQLiteCpp) — full API parity, honoring the §2 compatibility contract byte-for-byte.
- **Memory:** jobs **run to completion** (no mid-job cancel); mmap model weights + a per-job `std::pmr` arena reset at job end + mimalloc/jemalloc + **ASan/LSan in CI**.
- **Build:** **CMake + Ninja + vcpkg**, CTest, Catch2 (tests) + Google Benchmark (bench).
- **Dataset:** English + German + Russian clips (LibriSpeech + Common Voice + a 2-speaker AMI clip + one m4a); pin lib + model revisions; diarization goldens from the **vendored** `app/models/speaker-diarization-community-1.3533c8cf/` checkpoint (no HF token).

## Where to start

**Phase 0 is a decision gate, not just CMake setup.** Deliver: the `whisperx_core`
pybind scaffold (CMake+Ninja+vcpkg, ASan/LSan on), the **golden-vector generator**
over the EN/DE/RU clip set (transcript dumped as a *separate* artifact), pinned
manifest, CTest+Catch2 green, and a CI job. Then follow the critical path:

```
0 scaffold+goldens+decisions ─┬─► 1 DB (replace store.py)        [parallelizable]
                              └─► 2 decode+VAD ─► 3 alignment ─► 4a ASR / 4b diarize ─► 5 writers+e2e
                                                   (Python ASR feeds 3 until 4a lands)
6 timing gates accrue from Phase 2 on.
```

**Phase 3 (alignment) is the highest risk — front-loaded deliberately.** Validate
wav2vec2 ONNX export + the Viterbi port to golden parity *early*; if it's going to
fail, fail here. See the Phase 3 brief's parallelization section (batch inference
bucket-by-length + **mask padded frames** — masking is a golden-parity gate).

## Working agreement

- A phase is **done** when its stage matches Python on the golden set within the
  brief's tolerances, with the `WHISPERX_CORE_STAGES` flag on. Each brief's
  **Validation** section is the definition of done.
- Keep the **Python pipeline runnable** as the oracle the whole way (pybind makes
  this in-process). Never break `import whisperx` or the existing pytest suite.
- Port pure algorithms **verbatim** where the brief says so (Viterbi, IntervalTree,
  merge_chunks, writers) and golden-test them in isolation.
- Surface any **decide-during** question (per-phase Unknowns) before guessing —
  e.g. ONNX export opset, `default_asr_options` mapping, float/JSON formatting,
  CI timing-noise gating, the diarization CoreML-EP-vs-CPU benchmark. None block
  starting.

## First three concrete tasks

1. Stand up the CMake/Ninja/vcpkg project producing an importable `whisperx_core`
   pybind module (one real function, ASan/LSan on, CTest green in CI).
2. Write the golden generator: run the live Python pipeline over the EN/DE/RU
   clips, dump per-stage intermediates **+ the transcript separately**, with a
   pinned manifest (lib + model revisions + sha256).
3. Lock the **tolerance budget** by measuring torch-vs-ORT emission drift on one
   clip; record the chosen epsilon/frame values in the briefs.

When in doubt, the migration plan §6 roadmap and the per-phase briefs are the
contract; deviations should be raised, not silently taken.
